### **IN PROGRESS GRAMMARS**
**Original / Not working**
    gram    : _ ruler ;
    ruler   : < rule > ;
    rule    : id '=' _ exprr ;
    id      : upcase _ ;
        exprr   : < expr > ;
    expr    : id not '=' ;
    _       : [ ' ' ] ;
**Partially Working**
There is a definite difference between how the parser recognizes uppercase and lowercase.
