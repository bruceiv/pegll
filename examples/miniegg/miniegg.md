###  **GENERAL DESCRIPTION**
An originally Egg Parsing grammar created by Aaron Moss ported into the GoGLL grammar to determine test a given structure. Modification of `miniegg` grammar from [Egg](https://github.com/bruceiv/egg/blob/deriv/grammars/miniegg.egg) to test an example structure.
### **STATUS ON GRAMMAR**
#### *Markdown File Creation:* Working
#### *Parser Generated :* Complete
#### *Test File Creation:* Incomplete
#### *Testing Results:* Unknown

- not sure if id is functioning the way it should - going based on how basic IDs work

`Grammar` is the semantic starting rule for the `miniegg` grammar. It calls for a space and then one or more repetitions of rules through `RuleRep`.
```
Grammar : " " RuleRep ;
```
`Rule` is the semantic rule for a rule which is defined by an identifer followed by the character '=' while `RuleRep` is the semantic rule for an expression repeating one or more times until empty. This is accomplished by the ability for recursive calls in semantic rules and the ordered-choice `/` operator. See the [grammar for details.](../../gogll.md)
```
RuleRep : Rule RuleRep
        / empty ;
Rule    : id eq " " ExprRep ;
```
`Expr` is the semantic rule for an expression which is defined by an identifer then any character other than '=' while `ExprRep` is the semantic rule for an expression repeating one or more times until empty. This is accomplished by the ability for recursive calls in semantic rules and the ordered-choice `/` operator. See the [grammar for details.](../../gogll.md)
```
ExprRep : Expr ExprRep
        / empty ;
Expr    : id neq ; 
```
`id`, `eq`, and `neq` are lexical rules representing an identifier beginning with an uppercase letter followed by a space, the '=' character literal any any character that is not '=' respectively. 
```
id      : upcase ' ' ; 
eq      : '=' ; 
neq     : not "=" ;

```
