### **`A~BC` Grammar Guide**
The following grammar tests ordered choice in GoGLL. This grammar attempts to exercise ordered choice through the elimination of the `"ab"` branch.
```
package "axbc"
```
`AxBC` is a semantic starting rule that is composed of the semantic rule `AorB` followed by the character 'c'.
```
AxBC    : AorB "c"  ;
```
`AorB` is a semantic rule that represents the ordered choice of a string beginning with `'a'` zero or more times, with the alternate choice being the string `"ab"`. Here the lexical rule `/` is utilized for ordered choice/ See the [grammar for details.](../../gogll.md)
```
AorB    : as / "ab" ;
```
`repa0x` consists of the repeated token of `a` zero or more times. The use of the bracketed expression`{}` within this grammar is to indicate a set of tokens or identifiers repeated zero or more times. See the [grammar for details.](../../gogll.md)
```
repa0x  : { 'a' }   ;
```
