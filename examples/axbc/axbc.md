### **`A~BC` Grammar Guide**
The following grammar tests ordered choice in GoGLL. This grammar attempts to exercise ordered choice through the elimination of the `"ab"` branch.
```
package "axbc"
```
`AxBC` is a semantic starting rule that is composed of the semantic rule `AorB` followed by the character 'c'.
```
AxBC    : AorB "c"  ;
```
`AorB` is a semantic rule that represents the ordered choice of a string beginning with `'a'` zero or more times, with the alternate choice being the string `"ab"`. Here the lexical rule `/` is utilized for ordered choice/ See the [grammar for details.](../../gogll.md). A key aspect of this grammar is that each character must be an individual token, otherwise the lexer's longest-match tokenization process defeats the PEG semantics.
```
AorB    : Repa0x / "a" "b" ;
```
`Repa0x` consists of the repeated token of `a` zero or more times. Similarly to `AorB`, this must be done in a semantic rule to preserve the proper PEG behaviour.
```
Repa0x  : "a" Repa0x / empty ;
```
