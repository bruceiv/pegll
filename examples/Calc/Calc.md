###  **GENERAL DESCRIPTION**
An originally Egg Parsing grammar created by Aaron Moss ported into the GoGLL grammar to test a simple calculator. Modification of `calc` grammar from [Egg](https://github.com/bruceiv/egg/blob/deriv/grammars/Calc.egg) to calculate based on given inputs.

### **`calc` GRAMMAR GUIDE**
The following grammar tests simple calculations, order of operations under consideration, based on a given input.
```
package "calc"
```
`EXPR` represents the starting rule for the grammar being a semantic rule composed of a space followed by a `SUM`.
```
EXPR             : space SUM                     ;
```
The following section is composed of `SUM`, `RepPLUSorMINUS0x`, and `PLUSorMINUS`, where:
- `SUM` is a semantic rule matched with `PRODUCT` followed by `RepPLUSorMINUS0x`;
- `RepPLUSorMINUS0x` is a semantic rule matched by zero or more repetitions of addition or subtraction;
- `PLUSorMINUS` is a semantic rule matched by adding or subtracting a `PRODUCT`.
```
SUM              : PRODUCT RepPLUSorMINUS0x      ;
RepPLUSorMINUS0x : PLUSorMINUS RepPLUSorMINUS0x 
                 / empty                         ;
PLUSorMINUS      : PLUS PRODUCT 
                 | MINUS PRODUCT                 ; 
```
The following section is composed of `PRODUCT`, `RepTIMESorDIV0x`, and `TIMESorDIV`, where:
- `PRODUCT` is a semantic rule matched with `ELEMENT` followed by `RepTIMESorDIV0x`;
- `RepTIMESorDIV0x` is a semantic rule matched by zero or more repetitions of multiplication or division;
- `TIMESorDIV` is a semantic rule matched by multiplication or division an `ELEMENT`.
```
PRODUCT          : ELEMENT RepTIMESorDIV0x       ;
RepTIMESorDIV0x  : TIMESorDIVIDE RepTIMESorDIV0x 
                 / empty                         ;
TIMESorDIVIDE    : TIMES ELEMENT  
                 | DIVIDE ELEMENT                ;
```
The following section is composed of `ELEMENT`, `Number`, and `repNumber1x`, where:
- `ELEMENT` is a semantic rule matched with `SUM` enclosed by `OPEN` and `CLOSE` or a number;
- `Number` is a semantic rule matched by `repNumber1x` followed by a space;
- `repNumber1x` is a lexical rule matched by a `number` repeated one or more times.
For more information about the `number` reserved word, see the [grammar for details.](../../gogll.md)
```       
ELEMENT          : OPEN SUM CLOSE 
                 | Number                        ;
Number           : repNumber1x space             ;
repNumber1x      : < number >                    ;
```
The following section is composed of `PLUS`, `MINUS`, `TIMES`, `DIVIDE`, `OPEN`, and `CLOSE`, where:
- `PLUS` is a semantic rule matched with a '+' character followed by a space;
- `MINUS` is a semantic rule matched with a '-' character followed by a space;
- `TIMES` is a semantic rule matched with a '*' character followed by a space;
- `DIVIDE` is a semantic rule matched with a '/' character followed by a space;
- `OPEN` is a semantic rule matched with a '(' character followed by a space;
- `CLOSE` is a semantic rule matched with a ')' character followed by a space.
```
PLUS             : "+" space                     ;
MINUS            : "-" space                     ;
TIMES            : "*" space                     ;
DIVIDE           : "/" space                     ;
OPEN             : "(" space                     ;                
CLOSE            : ")" space                     ;
```
`space` is a lexical rule composed of the whitespace characters ' ' and '\t'. It may be repeated zero or mroe times as defined by the `{}` in the GoGLL grammar. See the [grammar for details.](../../gogll.md)
```
space            : { ' ' 
                 | '\t' }                        ;
```
