### **`eggr` GRAMMAR GUIDE**
The following grammar takes a given structure and tests the grammars capability to match the structure of `Egg` parsing grammar.
```
package "eggr"
```
The following sections handles the grammar, rules, and choices:
- `Grammar` is matched by at least one rule;
- `Rule` is an identifier equal to a choice;
- `Choice` is zero or more piped sequences. 
```
Grammar                 : WS  Rule RepRule0x            ;
        RepRule0x       : Rule RepRule0x
                        / empty                         ; 
Rule                    : Identifier EQUAL Choice       ;

Choice                  : Sequence RepPipedSeq0x        ;
     RepPipedSeq0x      : PIPE Sequence RepPipedSeq0x
                        / empty                         ; 
```
The following sections handles sequences and expressions, where:
- `Sequence` is one or more expressions;
- `Expression` uses operators of the grammar to determine rules. 
```
Sequence                : Expression RepExpr0x          ;
        RepExpr0x       : Expression RepExpr0x
                        / empty                         ;

Expression              : AND Primary 
                        | NOT Primary 
                        | Primary OptStarPlus           ;                     
    OptStarPlus         : OPT 
                        | STAR
                        | PLUS
                        | empty                         ; 
```
The following sections handles `Primary` and `Identifier`, in which :
- `Primary` is matched by an `Identifier` followed by `NEQUAL`, a `Choice` enclosed in parentheses, `StringLiteral`, `CharLiteral`, `CharClass`, `ANY`, or `EMPTY`;
- `Identifier` is matched by a letter followed by whitespace and then a letter or number combination repeated zero or more times.
```
Primary                 : Identifier NEQUAL
                        | OPEN Choice CLOSE
                        | StringLiteral
                        | CharLiteral
                        | CharClass
                        | ANY
                        | EMPTY                         ;

Identifier              : LetWS LetOrNum0x WS           ;
        LetWS           : let
                        / WS                            ;
     LetOrNum0x         : LetOrNum LetOrNum0x
                        / EMPTY                         ;     
       LetOrNum         : let
                        / num
                        / WS                            ;
        num             : number                        ;
        let             : letter                        ;
```
The following sections handles `StringLiteral`, `CharLiteral`, `CharClass`, and `Character` where:
- `StringLiteral` is any string literal matched by a character repeated zero or more times surrounded in double quotes and then followed by a whitespace;
- `CharLiteral` is any character literal, surrounded by single quotes, followed by whitespace;
- `CharClass` is the character class consisting of `UnclosedChars`, any character other than ']', repeated zero of more times; 
- `Character` is the semantic rule to represent a character in the `eggr` grammar. 
```
StringLiteral           : dQuote String dQuote WS       ;
        dQuote          : any "\""                      ;
        sQuote          : '\''                          ;
        String          : Character String
                        / empty                         ;

CharLiteral             : sQuote Character sQuote WS    ;

CharClass               : "[" UnclosedChars "]" WS      ;
        UnclosedChars   : UnclosedChar UnclosedChars 
                        / empty                         ;
        UnclosedChar    : notSqBk Character             ;
        notSqBk         : not "]"                       ;

Character               : esc
                        / notQuotesEsc                  ;  
   notQuotesEsc         : not "'\"\\" letter            ;
        esc             :'\\' any "nrt'\"\\"            ;  
```
The following section handles `EQUAL`, `NEQUAL` `PIPE`, `and`, `not`, `OPT`, `STAR`, `PLUS`, `OPEN`, `CLOSE`, `ANY`, and `EMPTY`, where:
- `EQUAL`  is a semantic rule representing the character '=' followed by whitespace;
- `NEQUAL` is a semantic rule representing any character except '=' followed by whitespace;
- `PIPE`   is a semantic rule representing the character '|' followed by whitespace;
- `AND`    is a semantic rule representing the character '&' followed by whitespace;
- `NOT`    is a semantic rule representing the character '!' followed by whitespace;
- `OPT`    is a semantic rule representing the character '?' followed by whitespace;
- `STAR`   is a semantic rule representing the character '*' followed by whitespace;
- `PLUS`   is a semantic rule representing the character '+' followed by whitespace;
- `OPEN`   is a semantic rule representing the character '(' followed by whitespace;
- `CLOSE`  is a semantic rule representing the character ')' followed by whitespace;
- `ANY`    is a semantic rule representing the character '.' followed by whitespace;
- `EMPTY`  is a semantic rule representing the character ';' followed by whitespace.
```
EQUAL                   : "="   WS                      ;
NEQUAL                  : neq   WS                      ;
        neq             : not "="                       ;
PIPE                    : "|"   WS                      ;
AND                     : "&"   WS                      ;
NOT                     : "!"   WS                      ;
OPT                     : "?"   WS                      ;
STAR                    : "*"   WS                      ;
PLUS                    : "+"   WS                      ;
OPEN                    : "("   WS                      ;
CLOSE                   : "("   WS                      ;
ANY                     : "."   WS                      ;
EMPTY                   : ";"   WS                      ;      
```     
The following section handles `WS`, `SpaceOrComment`, `space` and `endOfLine` where: 
- `WS` is a semantic rule matching any kind of whitespace - a space/comment sequence or an EMPTY;
- `SpaceOrComment` is a semantic rule where either a `space` or `LineOrBlock` comment can be matched; 
- `space` is a lexical rule for escape characters representing a set of spaces or the end of line;
- `endOfLine` is a lexical rule for the escape characters that signify the end of the line. Any of these characters will indicate the end of line has been reached in `eggr`. 
```
WS                      : SpaceOrComment WS
                        / EMPTY                         ;
SpaceOrComment          : space
                        | LineOrBlock                   ;
space                   : any " \t\r\n"                 ;
endOfLine               : any "\n\r"                    ;  
```
The following section handles `LineOrBlock`, `lineComment`, and `blockComment` where:
- `LineOrBlock` represents the semantic rule for either a line or a block comment;
- `!lineComment` is a lexical rule representing a C-style line comment. Everything from the first slash to the end of line is a comment;
- `!blockComment` is a lexical rule representing a C-style block comment. Everything between and including `/*` and `*/` is a comment;
- The `!` in front of `!lineComment` and `!blockComment` instructs the lexer to suppress those tokens. See the [grammar for details.](../../gogll.md) 
#### *Note:* `!lineComment` and `!blockComment` were taken from [comments.md.](https://github.com/bruceiv/pegll/tree/main/examples/comments) 
```
LineOrBlock             : lineComment 
                        | blockComment                  ;
!lineComment            : '/' '/' { not "\n" }          ;
!blockComment           : '/''*' 
                        { not "*" 
                        | '*' not "/" 
                        } '*''/'                        ;       
```
