### **`ax` GRAMMAR GUIDE**
The following grammar tests the repeatability of a character, in this case 'a', within GoGLL. `Repa0x` represents the start rule while `repa0x` consists of the repeated token of `a` zero or more times. The use of `{}` within this grammar is to indicate a set of tokens or identifiers repeated zero or more times. See the [grammar for details.](../../gogll.md)

```
package "ax"

Repa0x : repa0x ;

repa0x : { 'a' } ;
```
