###  **GENERAL DESCRIPTION**
A modification of the `exp`[Egg](https://github.com/bruceiv/egg/blob/deriv/grammars/exp.egg) Parsing Grammar ported into the GoGLL to test an example grammar with possible exponential runtime under recursive descent.

### **STATUS ON GRAMMAR**
#### *Markdown File Creation:* Working
#### *Parser Generated :* Complete
#### *Test File Creation:* Incomplete
#### *Testing Results:* Unknown

### **`exp` GRAMMAR GUIDE**
The following grammar will utilize recursive descent to determine if exponential runtime occurs. `EXP` represents the starting semantic rule exercising recursive descent through calling itself within the characters 'a' then 'b', 'a' then 'c', or empty, choice based on the input grammar. Here, the `|` operator represents unordered choice. See the [grammar for details.](../../gogll.md).
```
package "exp"

EXP     : "a" EXP "b" 
        | "a" EXP "c" 
        | empty         ;
```
