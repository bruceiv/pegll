# Grammar G1

G1 is the grammar for one boolean expression.

```
package "g1"

Exp : Exp Op Exp
    | id
    ;
```

The first alternate `Exp : Exp Op Exp` of the production above is ambiguous and
will produce an ambiguous parse forest for expression with more than two `id`s.

```
Op : "&" | "|" ;
```

Op | Logic Operator
|---|---|
`&` | and
`|` | or

```
id : letter <letter | number> ;
```

`id` is the name of a boolean variable. It consists of one or more letters.
